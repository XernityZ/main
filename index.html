                    Hello! I am Xernity, an 11 year old programmer. I am currently learning web development, meaning I
                    am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I feel quite good at HTML and CSS but I am still working on
                    JavaScript. Though, I know some Python and most of Lua, so I know the basics of JavaScript.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm also a software enginner, meaning I make games. Some games I've made are: Bad Bat, Project
                    Launch, and other games. I've programmed in different softwares such as Roblox, Scratch, and a very
                    little bit of Unity. (You can see my games by clicking the menu bar then clicking 'Games'.)
